You are updating a public-facing website for a private equity firm to comply with Rule 506(c) of Regulation D for a global audience.

GOALS:
- Align site with a 506(c) posture (general solicitation permitted, accredited investors only)
- Treat institutional investors as qualifying accredited investors under Rule 501(a)
- Separate brand marketing (public) from fundraising (gated)
- Remove any content that could be construed as an offer or solicitation on public pages

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Apply all edits specified in `506c-website-updates.md`
2. Ensure all public pages:
   - Contain NO fund-specific details
   - Contain NO performance or return language
   - Use only neutral firm / platform descriptions
3. Implement an interstitial “Accredited Investor Confirmation” gate exactly as specified
4. Add footer links and disclaimers verbatim
5. Ensure Terms of Use references:
   - Rule 506(c)
   - Institutional and accredited investors
   - Jurisdictional restrictions
6. Do not introduce new fundraising language
7. Preserve existing design and layout where possible; modify copy and routing only

OUTPUT:
- Updated site files reflecting the above
- No commentary, explanations, or TODOs
